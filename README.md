Hey there! I'm Selvin Castillo, originally from Guatemala. Growing up, I didn't have game consoles, but one day I discovered emulators through my cousin's laptop. Since then, I've been fascinated by how technology can recreate those nostalgic experiences on almost any device with a screen.
Thanks to these emulators I got introduced to coding. I realized that coding not only powers these emulators but also creates pretty much all technology. That's why I'm pursuing a Computer Science degree at Georgia State University to understand how technology works and to create new programs mysefl.
Currently, I work in freight, and I've identified areas where technology can improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. I am currently looking for a software engineer internship that can help me get the experience and skills to implement these improvements effectively.
I bring a unique perspective from my background in labor jobs, where I've interacted closely with customers and coworkers. I'm excited to apply these experiences to innovate and make a meaningful impact in the software engineering field.
